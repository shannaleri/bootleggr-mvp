## Bootleggr MVP ##
#### React Native & Firebase ####

This project is simple as they come. The goal is to connect whiskey & wine tastings remotely in the style of Jackbox games; this MVP is being used to learn about how people interact with a tasting on a video call as opposed to attending a tasting in person. 

The [Circle Menu](src/components/CircleSelect.js) is likely the best place to look to get a feel for this & me, with a suggested follow up to the [Store](src/store/store.js).
